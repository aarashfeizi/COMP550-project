## The Idea

The idea of our project is to build a system to help reviewer against some "evil" conference which does not show you the score of each reviewer. To do that, we need to analyze the reviewer's opinion and the paper itself.



### The reviewer's opinion

The reviewer's opinion can be crawled from the ICLR open review conference paper. 



As for how to analyze them, Aarach and Kian will do the survey in this part.



### The paper itself

There is a package called _tika_ that can extract text directly from pdf. There is also some work to predict whether the paper should be accepted or not based on CV methods.



Fuyuan will do the survey in this part





### Deadline

We will meet some time around middle of next week, and hopefully finish the paper review parts in written language. If there isn't any further changes in this part, we will use them as related work in the final report.
